## 🐍 The Origin
Python was born in 1989 as a hobby of the programmer Guido Van Rossum, who initially aimed to continue the ABC language, which was being developed at the Dutch Research Center CWI.

## 🎯 Van Rossum's Objectives for the Python Language
- 🧠 A language that is easy and intuitive
- 🌐 Open source, so that everyone can contribute
- 📜 Code that is as readable as English
- ⚙️ Suitable for daily tasks and productive!

Guido started development in 1989 and in February 1991 the first version of Python, 0.9.0, was released. It wasn't until 1994 that version 1.0 of Python was released. The second version of Python was published in October 2000 and in 2001 the Python Software Foundation (PSF) was founded, which starting from Python 2.1 includes all the code, documentation, and language specifications. In 2008, Python version 3.0 was released, and currently, we are at version 3.10.2 of Python.

## 🌍 Where Should I Use the Language?
Python is a very versatile language!
- 💪 Strong and dynamic typing
- 🔄 Cross-platform and multi-paradigm
- 👥 Large and active community
- 📉 Low learning curve

## 🥧 First Program

### 🍰 The Recipe
Programming consists of instructing the computer with a sequence of routines that must be processed. Imagine a cake recipe: we need to know the ingredients and the preparation method, following the instructions correctly to get a cake at the end of the process.

### 📝 Creating Our File
To create our cake recipe in Python, we need to create a file with the `.py` extension. With the file created, we can insert our ingredients and preparation method.
